    "This component of the assignment derives in part, with thanks and permission, from an [assignment](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs182/assignments/AlgorithmicDecisionMaking.zip) in Stanford's CS182: Ethics, Public Policy, and Technological Change. Their assignment, in turn, is based on the journalistic organization ProPublica's [analysis](https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing) of a criminal risk prediction algorithm which we discussed in the algorithmic fairness lecture. Here, you will be assessing how a classifier designed to predict recidivism -- that is, whether someone will commit a crime in the future -- performs in terms of algorithmic fairness metrics."

    "I see several issues here such as even though the overall AUC for black defendants is higher, the other metrics are raising concerns. Firstly, the False Positive Rate for Black defendants(0.4165) is much higher than that of White defendants(0.1719), which means that there is a higher chance for Black defendants to be falsely tagged for re-offend or recidivate as compared to white defendants, infact its 2.4 times more likely that a Black defendant is falsely tagged to recidivate. Secondly, the False Negative Rate for White defendants is much higher than that of Black defendants. This could mean that, even White defendants who are likely to re-offend are not classified as such, whereas Black defendants are. This is an example of severe racial discrimination. It is clear that the data is biased against Black defendants. Furthermore, there is predictive inequality as the difference between False Positive Rate and False Negative Rate for a particular class(black or white) are differing vastly. Also the fraction of Black defendants classified as postitve (0.5763) is much higher than that of White defendants(0.2982). According to this algorithm, it is nearly twice as likely for a Black defendant to be classified as positive than a White defendant.\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm clearly perpetuates the existing racial bias present in society and if it were to be deployed in practice, it could cause serious harm due to incorrect predictions - either keep an innocent person in prison due to wrongly predicting they would recidivate, or releasing prisoners to would go on to commit more crimes. In both cases there are several ethical issues here. At its present form, the algorithm cannot be used as the sole determinant of recidivism. In order to be used, it has to be modified on the principles of algorithmic fairness, the data needs de-biasing and human input will be needed to make the final call on if a defendant is likely to recidivate based on the model's outputs."

    "While designing my own model, my focus was to reduce the predictive inequalites and difference in odds between the classes. I tried different models such as Random Forest and XGBoost. Out of the two XGBoost performed better. Furthermore, I did a bit of preliminary exploration and also learnt from the class lecture that there are often other factors that are strongly correlated with Race such as Age and Gender. Hence I dropped these before training my model. I also tried to use SMOTE (https://machinelearningmastery.com/smote-oversampling-for-imbalanced-classification/) to reduce the class imbalance a bit but it did not help so I left it out. I also modified the column names using regex because XGBoost was giving me an error in processing columns which has '[]' or other such characters. Further, since I was going to use the XGBoost classifier I used a Standard Scaler to scale my data before training the model.\n",

    "I used grid search cross validation to obtain the best possible parameters for my XGBoost classifier model and then used these parameters to define the model. I then used the model for prediction and obtained class predictions as well as class probabilities. I used AUC score, F1 score, False Positive Rate, False Negative Rate and Accuracy (fraction of positive classifications) as metrics to evaluate my model. As you can see, the overall AUC is higher as compared to the logistic regression model. Also the AUC for White and Black defendants is higher. Furthermore, there is more the difference between the FPR and TPR rates becomes narrower than when logistic regression is used. \n",

The ethical implication of this is enormous and becomes even more critical if the degree of crime is severe.\n",

This is because as seen from the two very different types of models implemented above, there is an issue of bias in the data which becomes really hard to de-bias when the model is designed. These models are thus propagating existing racial biases in the society through biased datasets and amplifying them. Especially in critical scenarios like healthcare and criminal justice, one should always proceed with caution while using these models, and if they are used at all, the decisions must be reviewed and examined by humans/subject matter experts before finalising.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think the ProPublica Analysis gives an insight as to why there are several issues with deploying such models in the context of criminal justice. To add on to it, the metrics as highlighted above raise serious concerns with how accurate these models are. With hardly ~70% accuracy, it seems like a gamble on someone's life and freedom to treat these models' predictions as absolute ground truth and make decisions based on that.\n"
